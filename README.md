# Assignment 03: Relationships between variables 

This repository contains starter code for your Assignment 03 in EDS 222, which is focused on quantifying and visualizing relationships between two random variables.

The structure of the newly-cloned repository is as follows:

```
repo
|
-- README.md
|
-- .gitignore
|
-- R
   |
   -- assignment-03.Rmd
```

Start by cloning this repo as normal. Then, open up the `R/assignment-02.Rmd` file where you will find the questions and basic template for providing your answers. You should answer each question by inserting R code chunks in the relevant spaces. If there is no code chunk, the question is asking only for a qualitative (i.e., textual) answer, and no code is necessary. Whenever you "knit" this `R/assignment-02.Rmd` file, you will produce the corresponding `R/assignment-02.html` file. Please push both the .html and .Rmd files back to the remote repository for grading.

Please pay attention when I ask you to comment on your results in addition to coding them up.
